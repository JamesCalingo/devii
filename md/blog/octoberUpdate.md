You’re probably wondering why I stopped posting for almost a month.

Well, it’s cause I’m busy. 

October is a HUGE month for job hunters. Hiring slows down during the holiday months and doesn’t really pick up again until the new year I’ve been told, so I’m trying to see if I can get in before that point (i.e. the end of this month).

As such, I probably won’t be posting much around here ‘cause I’m going to be focusing on the job hunt - I ended up spending the last few weeks working on a project to help me work on some skills and get something on my resume. It’s not quite ready yet, but I will have something up here when it is (hopefully in the next couple of days).

Speaking of that project, I saw something on Twitter recently and thought that it was worth discussing.

(NOTE: I was going to post this yesterday, but I debated whether or not to post this. You'll see why as you read on.)

One of my philosophies that guides how I approach the internet is that no matter what you do, someone will find a way to "troll" it, intentional or not.

That seems to have happened with something known as Hacktoberfest.

For those who don’t know (like me before seeing Dan Abramov tweet about it), Hacktoberfest is a thing designed to encourage developers of all skill levels to contribute to open source software (OSS). OSS is the backbone of a lot of things (such as, well, React), and contributing to it is often viewed favorably by recruiters and companies.

I’m not sure if this was true in the past, but I saw that this year, if you submitted four “acceptable” contributions to any open source softwares, you could get a t-shirt and maybe some other stuff (I’m not sure). Apparently, a popular YouTube channel from India gave a rather moronic tip to get to those four contributions: Just call stuff “awesome”!

How is this moronic? Well, I’ll let Dan Abramov explain:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PLEASE don’t do this. <a href="https://twitter.com/hacktoberfest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hacktoberfest</a>, you are encouraging spam and creating noise. <a href="https://t.co/x8VPxunPTh">pic.twitter.com/x8VPxunPTh</a></p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1311692006775758853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you don't want to follow the image link, basically imagine updating the title of this blog from "Hacktober Update" to "James Calingo's Amazing Hacktober Update of Spectacular Wonder": pointless.

You can go through the replies if you want to see more (though some of them might not make sense if you don’t quite understand how to read code). One of them features an image of attempted contributions, and it’s crazy: only two out of eight are marked as accepted (the others are all labeled as “Invalid”), and six of the rejected ones all feature usernames that sound like they’re from...a certain part of the world. One contribution somehow manages to be both accepted and invalid at the same time as well!

As it turns out, though...the reason things ended up like they did was likely because of circumstance. It's easy for me, an American who lives in Northeastern suburbia, to look at things like this and say "why are people so idiotic?" However, according to something I saw, in India (where a lot of these "issues" are coming from), the economy is bad, COVID is rampant (India has the second most cases in the world), and people use web devlopment to get out of poverty without having many good teachers influencers. Also, as they're not exposed to "Silicon Valley culture", they don't know what people outside of their sphere of influence think of when they do these things. 

Abramov himself ended up arguing that the idea behind Hacktoberfest isn’t bad, it’s just that the whole “do some stuff to win sweet swag” model incentivizes people to contribute for the wrong reasons. People should be making meaningful contributions for the sake of the software and themselves, but Hacktoberfest (or at least this year’s version) has warped the idea of why people should contribute to open source.

And if you're wondering...I'm probably not going to participate. Again, need to focus on job hunt because time really is running out.
