How was your weekend? For some people, today is the first day of the workweek because yesterday is technically a federal holiday (even if a lot of people just ignore it).

Anyway, my weekend was a lot of working on code, some reading up on stuff, and me “going viral” on LinkedIn.

How did I go viral on LInkedIn?

As part of my job search coaching, I did a practice coding challenge. Everything I need to say about how that went can be summed up in what I posted on LInkedIn right after I did it Friday morning:

> I took a practice coding challenge this morning, and while I was able to think through how to solve the problems, I was not able to deliver 100% working solutions - only partial ones. Therefore, the challenge rated me as having solved zero problems.
>
> In the real world, you may run into people who will look at the steps you took towards solving a problem and give you credit for that. Unfortunately, however, you cannot predict when someone will do that, so practicing coding challenges, no matter how mundane it feels, is absolutely necessary if you want to get anywhere.
>
> It may suck, but I've seen anecdotal evidence of how LeetCode/HackerRank challenges are apparently a frequent part of interviews. I cannot speak for how companies use them, but if they're looking for a raw boolean of "did you solve the problem 100%" and the answer is "false", then that is likely to hurt your chances of getting that job.
>
> Of course, this is only my view. It may be different in reality, but until I have a better view, I have to operate under these pretenses.

As of this morning, this post has 12 comments, 25 likes, and over 2,000 views. I’ve also received a bunch of connections from it; I lost track of the actual number, but it’s a doozy.

The comments for this post both give me hope and worry me. One of the comments, which helps, is “as long as you can communicate how you would solve the problem, you’re fine”. However, it’s immediately met with “companies need to be choosy with who they interview”.

I’ve also been reading a lot of Reddit, and the sense I get from there is that while good CS background is nice, even CS grads are having trouble finding work - so the best thing to do is keep yourself ready to perform at all times.

One more thing: November is coming up soon, and that’s important because I’ve heard from multiple people that hiring slows down during November and doesn’t really pick up until the new year. Therefore, if you can’t find good opportunities before then, you risk a prolonged period where not much will come across your radar.

To prepare for the potential slowdown, I’m trying to shoot out a ton of applications as well as build a network. I feel that the network will be critical to future opportunities - if you build a strong network, then you’ll not only have more opportunities in the future, but better ones too (i.e. not having to gamble based on split Glassdoor reviews). In the present, obviously, there’s more opportunities, but also the hope that you can avoid the bad ones (i.e. those companies that give you some training then ship you wherever their clients are).

They say it takes just one connection to change everything.

I really hope to find that one connection soon.
