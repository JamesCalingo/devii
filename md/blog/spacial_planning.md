When New Jersey started its stay at home orders and my parents both started working from home, I moved my work setup from my living room to my bedroom for…reasons (and NO, it was not so I could turn off SafeSearch).

This was what it looked like when I first moved everything in:

Earlier this week, I decided to buy a USB keyboard from Best Buy for my Nintendo Switch (and also for my laptop, as a friend had recommended it). Along with a laptop stand (also recommended by my friend), this is what my work setup looks like now:

You'll also notice that my new setup has a lot more stuff on and under the desk. That's because the old setup photo was taken before I put all of that there...I don't have any photos of what this area looked like between the two photos (mostly because it was a total mess).

I feel like this new setup a lot more than the old one, despite its limitations (i.e. using a folding table for my laptop).

For starters, having the laptop on the same desk as my second monitor meant that it would be partially blocking the view to that monitor. If I’m sitting in the chair, then it’s not that much of an issue, but I like to play the Switch while sitting on my bed adjacent to the setup, and if my laptop was open, then the screen would be partially blocked. Now there’s less blocking of the screen, which lets me do more from my bed (though whether or not I'll actually have the time to is another story altogether - more on that tomorrow).

Also, with the old setup, I was using the big monitor as my second display. In this setup, I switched it to my primary display and it’s so much better. NO longer do I have to crane my neck to see what’s on my screen (I know the laptop stand is a way to mitigate this, but I’m nearsighted and I think this is better).

The only thing left to do is replace the chair I'm currently using, which is not in the photos. I bought it from Target in the mid 2000s and it’s rapidly falling apart - case in point: I have a bag of the screws that have fallen off; I would replace them, but if I’m replacing the chair itself there’s no real need to. Thing is, though, that i don’t have a lot of space to work with (especially now that the laptop is on a side table that needs to be there), so I’m going to have to see if I can get one that fits (I feel like a lot of chairs are too big for the space).

It’s not perfect, but it works. If I REALLY wanted to fit everything on one desk, I would need a bigger one. However, I don’t have the space for it.

At least for now...
