Do you ever go through old things you did or think about your old self and cringe at how you were back in the day?

I do it all the time.

Case in point: I recently decided to look back at some of my old stuff from past blogs (which you can check out if you so desire by following the “ link at the top of this page). Yes, there was some stuff there that I genuinely like and am proud of, but there’s also stuff there that just…ugh.

This is largely due to a desire for content. I had a goal where I would update them regularly, seeing as it was the closest thing I could claim to working, but would often not have good ideas. However, not updating to me felt unacceptable because if I wasn’t updating, it wouldn’t help my situation at all, so quality be damned - content is content.

Looking back, though, was that really a good idea?

Was it really necessary for me to say “This is me posting something because not posting is unacceptable” in blog form?

Should I really have done a running commentary of every episode of Seasons 1 & 2 of <i>The Mole</i>?

Did I really need to write about the time <a href ="https://lostmediaarchive.fandom.com/wiki/Creed%27s_Infamous_2002_AllState_Stadium_Chicago_Performance_(Lost_Footage" target="blank">Scott Stapp supposedly tried to do a show drunk and high on antibiotics?</a>

Younger me would have probably said “Yeah!” to it because CONTENT!

I mean, just think of all the things I <i>tried</i> to write but never published because I thought they were too stupid - were they really?

Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh right, my old crap.

If you click the link I mentioned earlier, you can see my old stuff for yourself and judge how good or bad it is (fun fact: I apparently had a reader who I didn’t know that liked a bunch of my posts). 

So what does all of this have to do with this current blog? Not much, really.
 However, I realized something recently:
A lot of why those old blogs were so chaotic was because they lacked a clear vision. I was trying to figure out a career path at the time and didn’t really have anything to base my posts off of, so I just did whatever I thought of.

Heck, we’re a few posts into this blog and I haven’t written a post about software development yet! Will that change?

Well…

Welcome to a new idea!

As I said a couple of days ago, I am currently looking for a job. As part of that search, I found a coaching/mentor program that has very much helped me immensely: In only a few days of this program, I feel like I’ve already achieved more for myself than I did in six months of post-coding bootcamp career coaching!

One of the major aspects of this program is the idea of daily accountability sessions. These are designed to make sure you did what you sought out to do that day, and part of that includes teaching something you learned that day. As someone who

I told the person who’s I’m doing these sessions with that I’d be done between 4-7 PM, so they’ll be posted within that time frame. Anyway, let’s begin:

Today, I learned about /“ /“.

What in the world is that? It’s something known as a slash/quote, and it’s kinda important in programming (mainly JavaScript). Y’see, quotes in programming are important, because that’s how you store the important data type known as strings. You can use either single quotes (’) or double quotes (“) when creating strings; however, there are certain limitations. The big one is apostrophes; if you’re using single quotes for your string and an apostrophe shows up, then your string will end at the apostrophe and anything after it will just confuse the crap out of your code editor.

So what would happen if you needed both an apostrophe and quotation marks in your string? Well, that’s where the slash quote comes in. It’s meant to act as quotation marks inside the string, so that it doesn’t end up breaking everything.

Personally, I had never known about this. I just used backticks (`) for everything because it’s easier to deal with; testing seemed to show that it works just as well, too. In fact, I use this for a lot of things, especially since you don’t have to deal with tedious concatenation!

You’ll also get a bonus one because I actually have one from yesterday too:

Yesterday, I learned about favicons!

Favicons (short for “favorite icons") are those little icons you see at the top of your browser (in the tabs). These mainly add another visual aspect to your browser tabs/bookmark list, and they’ve been around since around the turn of the millennium.

I “designed” one for myself in basically 10 seconds based on a few of my favorite things:

- Green: my favorite color (As well as the color of the header and footer of this site)
- the semicolon (;): my favorite punctuation mark (and an important part of coding)

These posts will probably be short but sweet (and DEFINITELY no where near as long as this one is), as I don’t want to waste a ton of time just writing down the day’s learnings. Again, I will do these daily as a help to myself and to any potential readers out there, so yay content I guess?

I’ll probably post other stuff as well. I ended up having A LOT of ideas to write about, and unlike my old drafts, I feel strongly that these are quality posts that are both insightful and helpful to people like me. There’s a clear vision for this blog now, and I hope to see it through - even after its original purpose has passed.

It’s funny: When I started this blog, I wasn’t sure what direction it would take. Yes, I said that it would largely be based on my work, but I wasn’t sure what that meant. Now that I have this idea that I need to follow through on for my own sake, it’s basically a coding blog - one of the things I said it COULD be.
