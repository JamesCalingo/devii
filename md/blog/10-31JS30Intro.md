First of all, happy Halloween everyone! I have no clue if people are trick-or-treating tonight, but I plan on wearing the same costume I’ve worn on Halloween for the past 15 or so years: my regular clothes!

Also, if I'm being honest, the scariest day of this year isn't Halloween; it's a different day entirely that I'm going to stop talking about for my own sanity.

Anyway…

About a year ago, I did a project where I created a bunch of random web pages/applications every day for a month. It was one of the biggest undertakings I had done at the time, and for a while I featured it on my resume and portfolio.

Last month, I took it off of both.

I didn’t feel it was doing enough for me in terms of proving myself as a developer. Yes, I could write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also relied heavily on Bootstrap (for CSS) and jQuery (for JS) to get things done. I also realized that there were other issues as well, like a lack of clear focus or days where I literally just did a plain HTML blog post instead of coming up with an interesting idea. Basically, it felt spammy more than substantial, and it didn’t seem to generate much feedback from anyone, so I felt that it was hurting me more than helping me.

However, the idea of coding every day is good practice when you’re trying to learn/get a job.

With that in mind, starting tomorrow, I’m going to be doing the JavaScript 30!

In case you’re wondering, it’s pretty well known by now, but the JavaScript 30 is a challenge where you code out 30 different JavaScript projects. The whole 30 days thing is really up to you or not, but since I’m busy trying to truly master JS, I figure one a day should be a good target while I do other things.

The real draw is that it uses pure JavaScript to get everything done - no React, no jQuery, nothing. Just plain ol’ JavaScript. This is important because having those basic JavaScript skills is what’s going to keep you going once you get further into your career and some new framework or library renders old ones obsolete (for proof, just look at what’s happening with the aforementioned jQuery).

Of course, it’s one thing to follow the projects; putting your own spin on them will elevate what you get out of the experience. I definitely want to tinker with these a bit. I’m not sure how, but I’ve got some ideas (Unit testing, TypeScript, who knows?)

If you want to see it, it's at [this page right here](https://jamescalingo.dev/jcjs30112020/). Day 0 (an introduction to the whole thing) is already there, and tomorrow, day 1 will be there too!
