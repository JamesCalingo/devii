Happy Friday blogosphere! Today, I wanted to give a reflection on what has happened in the past week. It’s been VERY different from what I was envisioning last weekend, but I think it’s been good.

Going in, I had four different “interviews” lined up. I wasn’t sure what would happen from any of them - I wasn’t really expecting to land any jobs, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to talk to people.

Each one of those taught me something different about how to make it as a developer.

On Monday, I spoke to a recruiter who gave me a lot of good advice to help my job search.

Tuesday, I had a “future facing interview” with a recruiter whose company wasn’t looking to hire my level of developer, but we did have a nice chat and it was a good way to “meet a company”, so to speak.

Wednesday’s call was with someone who actually wasn’t working as a recruiter! She was super helpful though; we spoke for almost half an hour, making it by far the longest call of the week.

Thursday, I had the final interview of the week. It was pretty short, but it probably represents the most innate value going forward since it’s the only one where the person mentioned me having potential opportunities with his company.

I also had a chance to put words to action.

Last week, sadly, I almost got duped by a “fake” interview. I was sent an email screening, and half an hour later I “got a job” with a promise of money to “set up a home office” - as if my current “home office” wasn’t good enough.

One of the questions I was asked in that screening was what I would do if someone questioned decisions I was making. I said that I would have a discussion with the person on why they disagree, what they think should be done, and how we can come together as a team.

My Monday post on LinkedIn got a sharp rebuke from someone. The person criticized the advice I was giving on networking, and went on to say that my things (LinkedIn and GitHub) were unimpressive (translation: I shouldn’t be job seeking right now unless I want to keep cycling the wagons forever).

I reached out to him to see if he had any advice on how to improve myself. Turns out, he did - a lot of it.

The whole exchange I had with him made me realize that I may have jumped into job hunting too soon. I don’t know if I’m truly ready to hit the market just quite yet; I can barely do a basic coding challenge, I don’t have even a mediocre understanding of data structures and algorithms, and I’m struggling to get the applications I feature on my resume to work.

“But the bootcamp you did last year should’ve prepared you, right?”

Well…I’ll talk about that some other time.

For now, though, it’s coding time. I have some plans for things I wanna do in the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned for that.

In fact, expect daily updates to be coming soon…


(In other news, version 17 of React came out the same day I was looking at buying hard copy books on it on Amazon, and it underscored the notion that, unfortunately, my preference for hard copy is going to cost me a ton of money!)
