Hi!

No, I didn't forget about this blog. I was just busy working on other things.

In the last post here, I mentioned that I was about to start working on the *JavaScript 30*. You can see that <a href="https://jamescalingo.dev/jcjs30112020" target="blank">here</a>.

December was me working on other projects. I was hoping that at least one of them would be done by now, but it's just a bit shy of that. I'll update here when anything's ready though.

And that's my update. I would like to just end it there, but I really can't.

Y'see...stuff got a bit real today. I know that's a bad way of putting it, but here's the thing:

I don't really like getting into politics. As today's events kinda show, it can be a bit of a cesspool at times. However, like a lot of people, I cannot ignore what happened as it pertains to the so-called United States of America - I say "so-called" because the idea of a "United" nation feels very empty right now.

I had a big, long thing I was working on for this back in November, but that got largely shelved due to other things (one of them being that, again, I don't really like getting into politics). I originally had a longer post for today, but after some thought, decided not to publish the whole thing. Honestly, I'm still not sure what to say, but I feel that SOMETHING should be said, so here goes:

We are about to enter the most important two weeks of our lives...as well as the most dangerous.

I'd like to believe that there is no one (or at least not enough people) who are like the fanatics involved in today's incident near me.

However, I know that there are people like them everywhere, including near me - I've heard stories and seen examples of this.

Because of that, it is also possible that these most fanatics (or people who believe that there's justification for their behavior) are much, much closer than you think... and that's
