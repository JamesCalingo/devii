Through 2017 and 2018, I had zero job offers. My situation was so bad that I could literally count on one hand the number of interviews I had for that whole period. I was going nowhere fast, and if that continued, who knows what would’ve happened.

And then the calendar changed to 2019.

Early in the year, while on a trip to New York City, I saw ads for an IT school and decided to look them up. At the same time, a random Google search brought up a coding bootcamp. I ended up deciding on the coding bootcamp, and about four months later, ended up with a certificate in web development.

Immediately after, I had some interviews with a company. I actually got sorta deep in interviewing with them, but a few things held me back from wanting to fully commit:

1. Another 12 weeks of training. Why sit through more learning when you’ve learned so much already?
2. The idea of “Location flexibility”. I wasn’t fond of being sent to who-knows-where when I had a strong connection with my friends here that I wasn’t ready to give up (at the time).
3. Contracts. I had heard things about the contracts they gave their developers on Glassdoor, and with my mom being a lawyer specializing in contracts, knew that you had to take them seriously or else you could end up with 

I ended up not pursuing the company further. Was this a mistake? It’s hard to know. Either way, I had decided to move on.

The job search continued in earnest. However, I had a new resource this time: the bootcamp provided a career coach who helped me get my stuff in order and gave me some advice. While I did learn from the sessions we had together, I never fully grasped what was being presented to me, and while the coaching pushed me <i>slightly</i> forward, it didn’t translate into much in the bigger picture.

I went back to applying for jobs, except unlike my last job search, I had solid proof of the skills I had. Unfortunately, not much was different: still no job, and not a lot of opportunities presented themselves. Hey, at least I was getting actual rejection messages instead of ghostings though!

I looked back as some of my classmates were getting jobs, and realized that it was a mixed bag: while some were charging forward with their developer careers, others were still struggling to find a way forward. For instance, there was a company I was told to look into that a few of my classmates ended up signing on with; I looked into them on Glassdoor…and found scathing reviews.

All this time, I was receiving emails and phone calls from recruiters about potential job openings. As nice as it was to be noticed, there were multiple problems with this:

- The jobs were often in who-knows-where
- They were often for senior positions/required experience I didn’t have (remember, I had JUST learned how to code)
- The recruiter wasn’t actually in the United States (I don’t like this because it feels shady)

A few of these recruiter calls could’ve led to stuff, as they said they’d try to help me out more than just what they were offering, but most of them fell by the wayside quickly.

One day, someone reached out to me on LinkedIn who claimed that they could help people get jobs as software developers. I accepted his invitation to connect, but didn’t really think much of it at the time.

2019 became 2020, and while I was still in the struggle of job hunting, I at least felt like something had changed and that I had more control of my situation than I did at the end of the previous year.
