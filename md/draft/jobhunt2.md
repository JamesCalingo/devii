Through 2017 and 2018, I had zero job offers. My situation was so bad that I could literally count on one hand the number of interviews and screenings I had for that whole period. I was going nowhere fast, and if that continued, who knows what would’ve happened. All I knew was that I was headed for a dangerous situation where my circumstances would be in control of me, instead of the other way around.

And then the calendar changed to 2019.

Early in the year, while on a trip to New York City, I saw ads for an IT school and decided to look them up. I had no clue what it would entail, but it seemed promising: an 80% placement rate and the promise of a rewarding career in IT. As good as that sounded, 80% is still kinda low for placement: knowing my luck, I'd end up in the 20% that didn't get placed and who knows if the whole thing would've been worth it by then.

At the same time, a random Google search brought up a coding bootcamp run by Rutgers. While they didn't give placement nubmers, they did mention how the web development field was expanding and offered career coaching to make me "employer competitive" in the market.

With the Rutgers name behind it (among other things), I ended up deciding on the coding bootcamp. Looking back, me doing something like coding bootcamp was almost inevitable: like I said before, I wanted to do graduate school, but time and resources were unlikely to work out. I was looking for a low skill, low pay job, and without the ability to gain new skills, was afraid that I'd get stuck in a low pay career for a long time (despite my parents saying I can always move forward).

Bootcamp was great: it gave me a reason to leave the house every day, something to do at home instead of endless nothing, and a bunch of new people to interact with. Plus, the instructor we had was knowledgable and had a good sense of humor, so there was never a dull moment. Four months after I made the decision to do it, I ended up with a certificate in web development, new skills to put on my new resume, and new skills that I have completely forgotten because I have never seen them on any job descriptions (looking at you, Handlebars).

The job search began in earnest again, but this time, instead of trying to sell myself on nebulous qualities and "fake experience", I had hard evidence of what I did and what I knew. In fact, I had some interviews with a company shortly after the bootcamp ended. I actually got sorta deep in interviewing with them, but a few things held me back from wanting to fully commit:

1. Another 12 weeks of training. Why sit through more learning when you’ve learned so much already?
2. The idea of “Location flexibility”. I wasn’t fond of being sent to who-knows-where when I had a strong connection with my friends here that I wasn’t ready to give up (at the time).
3. Financials. I had heard things about the contracts they gave their developers on Glassdoor, and with my mom being a lawyer specializing in contracts, knew that you had to take them seriously or else you could end up in some big trouble. In this case, it was you agreeing to a pay level that was notably below the market average for two years (comprable to what I would've gotten as an administrative assistant), and there was a hefty penalty to get out.

I ended up not pursuing the company further. Was this a mistake? It’s hard to say, but based on what I know now, I'm going to say it wasn't. Either way, I had decided to move on.

As the job search continued, I had a new resource this time to help me out that I didn't have before: the bootcamp provided a career coach who helped me get my stuff in order and gave me some advice. While I did learn from the sessions we had together, I never fully grasped what was being presented to me, and while the coaching may have pushed me <i>slightly</i> forward, it didn’t translate into much in the bigger picture.

In the end, unfortunately, not much changed from my pre-bootcamp searching: still no job, and not a lot of real opportunities presented themselves. Hey, at least I was getting actual rejection messages instead of ghostings though!

I looked back as some of my classmates were getting jobs, and realized that it was a mixed bag: while some were charging forward with their developer careers, others were still struggling to find a way forward. For instance, there was a company I was told to look into that a few of my classmates ended up signing on with; I looked into them on Glassdoor since they had some interest in me…and found scathing reviews.

All this time, I was receiving emails and phone calls from recruiters about potential job openings. As nice as it was to be noticed, there were multiple problems with this:

- The jobs were often in who-knows-where and I wasn't looking to relocate (at the time)
- They were often for senior positions/required experience I didn’t have (remember, I had JUST learned the basics of coding)
- It was a LinkedIn request, but the recruiter wasn’t actually in the United States (or their work history implied they weren't)

A few of these recruiter calls could’ve led to stuff, as they said they’d try to help me out more than just what they were offering, but most of them fell by the wayside quickly.

There's another aspect of the search that I should mention before I forget it: In the coding world, some interviews will have you trying to solve coding problems by creating programs that do certain things. More often than not, it'll be something so stupidly complex and specific that you'll never see it in a real working environment, but apparently you'll be fine so long as you explain your thought process of how you WOULD solve it.

I had a few of these coding challenge interviews...but what happened after these sessions was the same from every company I did them for: nothing. I was often too nervous and frustrated to figure out what to do, and the one time I had a question that I thought I did well on, there was another question on stuff I hadn't even touched!

One day, someone reached out to me on LinkedIn who claimed that they could help people get jobs as software developers. I accepted their invitation to connect, but didn’t really think much of it at the time. Remember this, though, because it'll be important down the line.

2019 became 2020, and while I was still in the struggle of job hunting, I at least felt like something had changed and that I had more control of my situation than I did at the end of the previous year. Whether or not that was true was a differnt story altogether, but moving from "nebulous soft skills" to "emperical hard skills" was a significant shift in my search.
