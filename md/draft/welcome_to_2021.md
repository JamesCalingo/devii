Hi!

No, I didn't forget about this blog. I was just busy working on other things.

In the last post here, I mentioned that I was about to start working on the *JavaScript 30*. You can see that <a href="https://jamescalingo.dev/jcjs30112020" target="blank">here</a>.

December was me working on other projects. I was hoping that at least one of them would be done by now, but it's just a bit shy of that. I'll update here when anything's ready though.

And that's my update. I would like to just end it there, but I really can't.

Y'see...stuff got a bit real today. I know that's a bad way of putting it, but here's the thing:

I don't really like getting into politics. As today's events kinda show, it can be a bit of a cesspool at times. However, like a lot of people, I cannot ignore what happened as it pertains to the so-called United States of America - I say "so-called" because the idea of a "United" nation feels very empty right now.

I had a big, long thing I was working on for this back in November, but that got largely shelved due to other things (one of them being that, again, I don't really like getting into politics). Honestly, I'm not sure what to do with THIS post, but I do think I have one thing I want to say:

The people involved in this trust one man, and one man *ALONE*. It should be obvious who this person is, but I'd rather not say it. Yes, I am aware that this is probably a bit petty, but I honestly don't feel like naming any names.

This person got to where they are by conniving his way into politics from the outside. You may have forgotten about it (and I can't blame you for doing so), but 2016 was *not* his first fray into the political ring: it was a failed presidential bid in 2012. However, lessons must have been learned in that experience, because when he came back in 2016, he was unstoppable.

How? There's a long list of reasons how this came to be, but I'm not going to get into that. What's important here, though, is that once the man's "political party" (I'll explain the quotes later) realized that he was taking over, all they could do was step aside lest they receive a public lashing.

The party wanted the man to be useful to them - to push their agenda on the country and their beliefs into law. The man was happy to comply - to a point. He did have his own desires as well, and he essentially guilt tripped the party into going with him via something he gained that catapulted him to the top: his fanbase.

These fans loved his supposed bluster, toughness, and realism. He told them that things were horribly broken (which they are) and that he knew exactly how to fix things - and they believed it. If anyone were to challenge the man, his fans would rush to his defense immediately by berating the challenger.

Of course, this is America, so those fans have a powerful weapon at their disposal: voting. If someone were to challenge the man, that person would almost certainly face a challenge from another person "within the political party" who was a fervent supporter of the man, and that person could use that to carry favor with the fans.

This put the party in a bad spot: go with what the man did and said or face a tirade from the man and his fans - or worse, lose your seat of power.

He also saw other places where he could frighten people into supporting him and used them to his advantage. One of the most notorious examples of this is with Miami's Hispanic community, which surprised everyone with how much they supported him simply by him saying that his opponent would plunge America into "socialism".

As a side note, in some ways, it feels like some of the grandstanding we've seen over the past few months is people saying "Hey, we don't like things here too, so if/when your guy doesn't come back in 2024, we'll carry the torch." It's kinda silly and probably a bit dangerous, but given where people believe the support in the political party lies, it does make a bit of sense.

However...the man's fans don't care about the political party anymore.

They care about HIM and HIM alone. In their minds, no one else matters. 

Between the November election and yesterday's results in Georgia, it's clear that the end is near for the man. Because of this, the political party he wants to believe are his lackeys is slowly trying to make him see reality for what it is: he will no longer be in power, and will have to deal with the consequences of not only his four years as president, but other things as well.

He doesn't want to. And his fans are supporting him.

He thought that he'd be able to get by with creating a judicial supermajority, but to say that hasn't worked as he intended is a bit of an understatement - his cases have been denied by the Supreme Court in absolute routs.

Now, with the walls closing in and the party seemingly abandoning him, all he has left are his fans - fans who, through his actions, have become intensely distrustful of anyone who does not support the man.

What we saw today was those fans supporting the man by trying to make it impossible for him to be removed. In other words, an attempted coup.

Normally, a coup involves shifting the government heavily in your favor, or if that fails, the military. We saw both of these methods get tried out in the past few years, and it hasn't truly led to much of anything (thankfully). However, with how this country is set up, and given the events today, it's entirely possible that the military won't actually be necessary; instead, his fans - many of whom point to the Second Amendment to justify being armed with military equipment - can take care of things for him.

I HOPE TO GOD this is all I will need to say on this matter, but I can't be sure. All I know is this:

For many Americans, we are about to enter the most important two weeks of our lives...as well as the most dangerous.

No matter how bad it gets, we know that the man will not stop fighting. He will never believe that he lost the last election, nor will he believe that the will of the American people wasn't for him to become president in 2016 (remember, this country's quirky election process allowed him to win the election despite not having the most votes).

His fans will never see the new president as legitimate. They'll stew in their circles, maybe speak out now and then, but one thing's clear: if given the opportunity, they'd rather have no government than one led by anyone other than that man.

I'd like to end on this thought:

Hopefully, you've read what I've written here. 

I'd like to believe that there is no one (or at least not enough people) who are like the most fanatical of the man's fans who were involved in today's incident near me. After all, I live in one of the more Democratic parts of the country.

However, I know that the man has fans everywhere - I've heard stories and seen examples of this.

Because of that, it is also possible that these most extreme fans (or people who believe that this is the correct course of action) are much, much closer than you think... and that's
