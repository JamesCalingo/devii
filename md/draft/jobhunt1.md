As it says on the front page of this blog (as well as in my bio on my portfolio), I am a web/software developer. I am also a Psychology major/Music minor.

So how did I end up here?

That’s a good question!

Let me start with this. It’s a post I wrote on an old blog (edited a bit for clarity):

1:17 A.M.
CRAP!
I arrive at the top of the escalator that leads into Penn Station in New York City. It’s been a fun night out, but now I face a dilemma.
My train home leaves at 1:20, and if I don’t make it, I’m condemned to a night alone in Midtown Manhattan. Nothing is open, it’s cold and raining outside, and I don’t know what type of people are around at this time besides the homeless. The only thing I know is that I want to go home and sleep in my bed.

Problems arise immediately: I don’t have my ticket for the train. I should’ve gotten it when I first arrived on the way in, but I was in a rush to get to the event I came into the city for. I run to the vending machines to buy a ticket home.

1:18.
I buy my ticket, but it takes a little bit of time, especially when I have to find my station from the list, fumble with my wallet to get my card, and make sure to not get a receipt. Can’t leave personal information lying around in plain sight at Penn Station after all…

1:19.
I find which track my train is on…along with the status of my train: “ALL ABOARD”. This train is ready to leave, and I’m still in the waiting room!
My car is in the parking garage! What’ll happen if I miss this train? The garage doesn’t allow overnight parking…and my family is fast asleep right now…
I run as fast as I can to the stairs that lead to the platform. As I reach the platform, I hear an all too familiar sound:

*BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP*

THE DOORS ARE CLOSING!

I’M ALMOST ON THE TRAIN…WILL I MAKE IT?

I am almost out of breath and can barely move forward, but I know I have to. If I don’t, I’m guaranteed to miss this train, and I don’t want to know the consequences of what happens then.

I watch as the door starts to close. If I can just get part of my body into the door frame, It’ll be forced to reopen and I’ll be able to get on. It might hurt a bit, but it won’t hurt as much as missing the train altogether.

I muster whatever strength I still have, reach toward the closing door, and…

You may have read that and thought, “there’s totally a deeper metaphor in there, isn’t there?”
…and you’d be right!

This was written in October of 2017 (October 24th, to be exact). At this point in my life, I was already past two years out of college with no job and no real idea of how to get one. My resume had zero "real" work experience, and I was trying to sell myself based on relatively scant experience volunteering at the front desk of a local American Red Cross office (as well as my position as a music coordinator for a church group). This post summed up my feelings/fears at the time: I had a small window of time to make things happen (to "get on the train"), and if they didn’t…who knows what would happen then.

Over the next year, I continued to apply to jobs (and got more time at the Red Cross), but got little feedback. I had TWO in-person interviews: one was for a sales position at a small company that ended up being kinda shady, the other was an office position for a company that assisted psychology professionals (remember, I was a Psych major). Like everything else at the time, neither lead anywhere. It reached the point where one day, after yet another job I had applied to said they were moving on with other candidates, I asked myself:

“Am I just completely unhireable?”

Additionally, I started to question what my career would look like. I had an interest I WANTED to take up in graduate school (this may still happen in the future), but without money, I wouldn’t be able to pursue that, and without a job, I wouldn’t have money (my parents explicitly told me they wouldn’t be able to financially support it without me pitching in). However, if that interest ended up not panning out, where would I be? Moving around from dead-end job to dead-end job, not making much due to my lack of skills (and thus, unable to do much of anything with my life)?

This has gotten way longer than I intended it to be, so I’ll stop here. It’s a good place to stop anyway, because there’s a major event coming up that will shape the course of the rest of the story (you can probably figure out what happened based on…well, everything).

(BTW, I did end up at Penn Station at 3 AM one time - long story...)
