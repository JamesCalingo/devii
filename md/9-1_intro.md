In college, one of the ways I was told to write essays was by using the six journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Well, using that advice, I'm going to answer those questions about myself and this blog. Here goes:

## Who are you?

James Calingo. It says so at the top and bottom of the page (well, at least the home page of this blog)!

## What are you doing?

Blogging, duh!

## Why are you doing this?

Because why not?

## You realize those are some pretty bad answers, right?

Okay, fine...let's start over.

My name is James Calingo, and I am a web/software developer!

...Or at least, that's what I'd like to be. Currently, though, I'm looking for work.

Outside of that, I am a musician (who plays...a few instruments), video gamer (with a bunch of retro consoles, a 2015 Macbook, and a Nintendo Switch), board game collector (which my parents aren't super fond of), and a sports enthusiast (with a soft spot for Australian Rules Football...even though I'm not Australian nor have I ever been there).

My purpose for this blog is...a good question. Ideally, it'd be a place where I could write my thoughts on work, social interactions, and life in general. I'd also like to believe that I'm what the masses consider as "funny" (Spoiler alert: I'm not).

As for how often I'm going to post here...that depends. Again, currently looking for work, hoping to be actually working soon, so updates on this blog will probably come between that, Animal Crossing, and screaming at my laptop in C# (hey, that's a double joke!).
(There is actually one more reason updates may be a bit scant soon. Not sure if it's going to happen, but I will let you know if it does.)

Anyway, I hope that helps you understand a bit of who I am and what this blog is about. The bare minimum should be about one post a week, and since I posted yesterday, that makes two!

And in case you were worried about averages...we'll see what happens.
