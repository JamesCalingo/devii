In college, one of the ways I was told to write essays was by using the six journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Well, using that advice, I'm going to answer those questions about myself and this blog. Here goes:

## Who are you?

James Calingo. It says so at the top and bottom of the page (well, at least the home page of this blog)!

## What are you doing?

Blogging, duh!

## Why are you doing this?

Because why not?

## You realize those are some pretty bad answers, right?

Okay, fine...let's start over.

My name is James Calingo, and I am a web/software developer!

Or at least, that's what I'd like to be. Currently, though, I'm looking for work.

I live in New Jersey...for now. 

My purpose for this blog is...a good question. Ideally, it'd be a place where I could write my thoughts on work, social interactions, and life in general. 

I'd also like to believe that I'm what the masses consider as "funny".
Spoiler alert: I'm not.
