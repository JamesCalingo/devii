<p>I do it all the time.</p>
<p>Case in point: I recently decided to look back at some of my old stuff from past blogs (which you can check out if you so desire by following the “ link at the top of this page). Yes, there was some stuff there that I genuinely like and am proud of, but there’s also stuff there that just…ugh.</p>
<p>This is largely due to a desire for content. I had a goal where I would update them regularly, seeing as it was the closest thing I could claim to working, but would often not have good ideas. However, not updating to me felt unacceptable because if I wasn’t updating, it wouldn’t help my situation at all, so quality be damned - content is content.</p>
<p>Looking back, though, was that really a good idea?</p>
<p>Was it really necessary for me to say “This is me posting something because not posting is unacceptable” in blog form?</p>
<p>Should I really have done a running commentary of every episode of Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of <i>The Mole</i>?</p>
<p>Did I really need to write about the time *<a href="https://lostmediaarchive.fandom.com/wiki/Creed%27s_Infamous_2002_AllState_Stadium_Chicago_Performance_(Lost_Footage)">Scott Stapp tried to do a show drunk and high on antibiotics?</a></p>
<p>Younger me would have probably said “Yeah!” to it because CONTENT!</p>
<p>I mean, just think of all the things I <i>tried</i> to write but never published because I thought they were too stupid - were they really?</p>
<p>Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh right, my old crap.</p>
<p>If you click the link I mentioned earlier, you can see my old stuff for yourself and judge how good or bad it is (fun fact: I apparently had a reader who I didn’t know that liked a bunch of my posts). </p>
<p>So what does all of this have to do with this current blog? Not much, really.
 However, I realized something recently:
A lot of why those old blogs were so chaotic was because they lacked a clear vision. I was trying to figure out a career path at the time and didn’t really have anything to base my posts off of, so I just did whatever I thought of.</p>
<p>Heck, we’re a few posts into this blog and I haven’t written a post about software development yet! Will that change?</p>
<p>Well…</p>
<p>Welcome to a new idea!</p>
<p>As I said a couple of days ago, I am currently looking for a job. As part of that search, I found a coaching/mentor program that has very much helped me immensely: In only a few days of this program, I feel like I’ve already achieved more for myself than I did in six months of post-coding bootcamp career coaching!</p>
<p>One of the major aspects of this program is the idea of daily accountability sessions. These are designed to make sure you did what you sought out to do that day, and part of that includes teaching something you learned that day. As someone who</p>
<p>I told the person who’s I’m doing these sessions with that I’d be done between 4-7 PM, so they’ll be posted within that time frame. Anyway, let’s begin:</p>
<p>Today, I learned about /“ /“.</p>
<p>What in the world is that? It’s something known as a slash/quote, and it’s kinda important in programming (mainly JavaScript). Y’see, quotes in programming are important, because that’s how you store the important data type known as strings. You can use either single quotes (‘ ’) or double quotes (“ “) when creating strings; however, there are certain limitations. The big one is apostrophes; if you’re using single quotes for your string and an apostrophe shows up, then your string will end at the apostrophe and anything after it will just confuse the crap out of your code editor.</p>
<p>So what would happen if you needed both an apostrophe and quotation marks in your string? Well, that’s where the slash quote comes in. It’s meant to act as quotation marks inside the string, so that it doesn’t end up breaking everything.</p>
<p>Personally, I had never known about this. I just used `` for everything because it’s easier to deal with; testing seemed to show that it works just as well, too. In fact, I use this for a lot of things, especially since you don’t have to deal with tedious concatenation!</p>
<p>You’ll also get a bonus one because I actually have one from yesterday too:</p>
<p>Yesterday, I learned about favicons!</p>
<p>Favicons (short for “favorite icons) are those little icons you see at the top of your browser (in the tabs). These mainly add another visual aspect to your browser tabs/bookmark list, and they’ve been around since around the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p>I “designed” one for myself in basically 10 seconds based on a few of my favorite things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green: my favorite color (As well as the color of the header and footer of this site)</li>
<li>the semicolon (;): my favorite punctuation mark (and an important part of coding)</li>
</ul>
<p>These posts will probably be short but sweet (and DEFINITELY no where near as long as this one is), as I don’t want to waste a ton of time just writing down the day’s learnings. Again, I will do these daily as a help to myself and to any potential readers out there, so yay content I guess?</p>
<p>I’ll probably post other stuff as well. I ended up having A LOT of ideas to write about, and unlike my old drafts, I feel strongly that these are quality posts that are both insightful and helpful to people like me. There’s a clear vision for this blog now, and I hope to see it through - even after its original purpose has passed.</p>
<p>It’s funny: When I started this blog, I wasn’t sure what direction it would take. Yes, I said that it would largely be based on my work, but I wasn’t sure what that meant. Now that I have this idea that I need to follow through on for my own sake, it’s basically a coding blog - one of the things I said it COULD be.</p>]]></description><link>https://vriad.com/blog/til1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vriad.com/blog/til1</guid><category><![CDATA[TIL]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Colin McDonnell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:56:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spacial Planning]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When New Jersey started its stay at home orders and my parents both started working from home, I moved my work setup from my living room to my bedroom for…reasons (and NO, it was not so I could turn off SafeSearch).</p>
<p>This was what it looked like when I first moved everything in:</p>
<p><img src="/images/theBefore.JPG" alt="My old setup" /></p>
<p>Earlier this week, I decided to buy a USB keyboard from Best Buy for my Nintendo Switch (and also for my laptop, as a friend had recommended it). Along with a laptop stand (also recommended by my friend), this is what my work setup looks like now:</p>
<p><img src="/images/theAfter.JPG" alt="The new/current setup" /></p>
<p>You'll also notice that my new setup has a lot more stuff on and under the desk. That's because the old setup photo was taken before I put all of that there…I don't have any photos of what this area looked like between the two photos (mostly because it was a total mess).</p>
<p>I feel like this new setup a lot more than the old one, despite its limitations (i.e. using a folding table for my laptop).</p>
<p>For starters, having the laptop on the same desk as my second monitor meant that it would be partially blocking the view to that monitor. If I’m sitting in the chair, then it’s not that much of an issue, but I like to play the Switch while sitting on my bed adjacent to the setup, and if my laptop was open, then the screen would be partially blocked. Now there’s less blocking of the screen, which lets me do more from my bed (though whether or not I'll actually have the time to is another story altogether - more on that tomorrow).</p>
<p>Also, with the old setup, I was using the big monitor as my second display. In this setup, I switched it to my primary display and it’s so much better. NO longer do I have to crane my neck to see what’s on my screen (I know the laptop stand is a way to mitigate this, but I’m nearsighted and I think this is better).</p>
<p>The only thing left to do is replace the chair I'm currently using, which is not in the photos. I bought it from Target in the mid 2000s and it’s rapidly falling apart - case in point: I have a bag of the screws that have fallen off; I would replace them, but if I’m replacing the chair itself there’s no real need to. Thing is, though, that i don’t have a lot of space to work with (especially now that the laptop is on a side table that needs to be there), so I’m going to have to see if I can get one that fits (I feel like a lot of chairs are too big for the space).</p>
<p>It’s not perfect, but it works. If I REALLY wanted to fit everything on one desk, I would need a bigger one. However, I don’t have the space for it.</p>
<p>At least for now…</p>]]></description><link>https://vriad.com/blog/spacial_planning</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vriad.com/blog/spacial_planning</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Colin McDonnell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:39:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Proper Introduction]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In college, one of the ways I was told to write essays was by using the six journalistic questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Well, using that advice, I'm going to answer those questions about myself and this blog. Here goes:</p>
<h2 id="whoareyou">Who are you?</h2>
<p>James Calingo. It says so at the top and bottom of the page (well, at least the home page of this blog)!</p>
<h2 id="whatareyoudoing">What are you doing?</h2>
<p>Blogging, duh!</p>
<h2 id="whyareyoudoingthis">Why are you doing this?</h2>
<p>Because why not?</p>
<h2 id="yourealizethosearesomeprettybadanswersright">You realize those are some pretty bad answers, right?</h2>
<p>Okay, fine…let's start over.</p>
<p>My name is James Calingo, I currently live in New Jersey, and I am a web/software developer!</p>
<p>…Or at least, that's what I'd like to be. Currently, though, I'm looking for work.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I am a musician (who plays…a few instruments), video gamer (with a bunch of retro consoles, a 2015 Macbook, and a Nintendo Switch), board game collector (which my parents aren't super fond of), and a sports enthusiast (with a soft spot for Australian Rules Football…even though I'm not Australian nor have I ever been there).</p>
<p>My purpose for this blog is…a good question. Ideally, it'd be a place where I could write my thoughts on work, social interactions, and life in general. I'd also like to believe that I'm what the masses consider as "funny" (Spoiler alert: I'm not).</p>
<p>As for how often I'm going to post here…that depends. Again, currently looking for work, hoping to be actually working soon, so updates on this blog will probably come between that, Animal Crossing, and screaming at my laptop in C# (hey, that's a double joke!).</p>
<p>(There is actually one more reason updates may be a bit scant soon. Not sure if it's going to happen, but I will let you know if it does.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope that helps you understand a bit of who I am and what this blog is about. The bare minimum should be about one post a week, and since I posted yesterday, that makes two!</p>
<p>But in case you were worried about averages…we'll see what happens.</p>]]></description><link>https://vriad.com/blog/2020-9-2</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vriad.com/blog/2020-9-2</guid><category><![CDATA[introduction]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Colin McDonnell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 12:33:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Test Post]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Will this work?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>And if it does, should I leave it up?</p>
<p>Well, judging by the fact that someone (who is not me) is reading this right now, then…yes.</p>
<p>So anyway…welcome!</p>
<p>The hardest part was figuring out how to get the time posting accurate. For those who don't know (which is probably a lot of you), I'ma let you in on a little secret:</p>
<p>This is some pertinent information for this post:</p>
<pre><code>title: Test Post
published: true
datePublished: 1599000000000
</code></pre>
<p>You'll probably notice that ridiculous number next to the "datePublished" field and wonder "What does that have to do with today's date?"</p>
<p>Well, it's the number of milliseconds that have passed since December 31, 1969.</p>
<p>Why that date?</p>
<h1 id="becausewhynot">Because why not?</h1>
<p>Okay, let me actually regail you for a bit:</p>
<p>It's related to something known as a Unix timestamp, which is how the publish dates are generated for this blog. For whatever reason, they chose midnight on January 1, 1970 UTC as point 0 for their system (or "the Unix Epoch"). and the number of seconds since then is how the Unix timestamp is generated. For example, the Unix timestamp for midnight on my birthday this year is 1581206400.</p>
<p>Small note: the reason I said December 31, 1969 earlier is because I am in the U.S. Eastern time zone, which is 4-5 hours behind UTC depending on whether or not we're in Daylight Savings/Summer time. Also, I think this is supposed to be mesured in seconds, but my times are in milliseconds. Weird, I know. </p>
<p>Before I found a website to get the actual Unix timestamp for today, I was just messing with the numbers to try and get something closeish to today, and I ended up finding that and settling on it!</p>
<p>Truth be told, this is being written a day in advance, but with the timestamp spitting out September 1, that feels like a good day to "start", does it not? Also, of course, I had to figure out how to get this all up and running, so that kinda helped move things along.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been rambling for a while now, and unless you're someone I know, you're probably wondering</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is writing this?</li>
<li>Why are they doing this?</li>
<li>Why are they like this?</li>
</ul>
<p>To which I answer:</p>
<p>You'll have to give me a day or so.</p>
<p>(P.S.: If you wanna have some fun with Unix timestamps, <a href="https://www.unixtimestamp.com/" target="blank">here's</a> the site I used to convert them. I don't wanna think about how I'll have to change this system in 18 years though…)</p>]]></description><link>https://vriad.com/blog/2020-9-1</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://vriad.com/blog/2020-9-1</guid><category><![CDATA[test posting]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Colin McDonnell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 22:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
